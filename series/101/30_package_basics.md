{% alert warn %}
You need to install `npm` before you can start to rock. See <a href="20_getting_started.html"> the getting started guide </a> for more info.
{% endalert %}

In the following section we will give you a gentle introduction on how to create a component for BioJS 2.0.
As a case study, we will build a simple parser to read SNPs from Manny.
In the next tutorial we will show you how to visualize this data.

1) Create a new package
--------------------------------------------

Use our [slush generator](https://github.com/biojs/slush-biojs) to bootstrap your new project.

{% alert warn %}
On Linux and Mac you will need to prepend `sudo` for global (`-g`) installations
{% endalert %}


1) Install slush

~~~
npm install -g slush slush-biojs
~~~

2) Install watchify & sniper (optional)

~~~
npm install -g watchify biojs-sniper
~~~

`Watchify`: Listens for file changes and incrementely runs `browserify`
`Browserify`: A tool to lets you `require('modules')` in the browser by bundling up all of your dependencies
`sniper`: Simulates the BioJS registry and allows you to load files from your disk (it is a local file server)

3) Bootstrap your new project

~~~
mkdir <your-project>
cd <your-project> && slush biojs
~~~

4) Answer all questions

Our first component will be a pure parser, so you can answer `no` when being asked
for visualization support (the next tutorial will use this parser for a visualization).

~~~
? Module name?: biojs-vis-msa
? Description?: An awesome BioJS component
? Module version?: 0.1.0
? Author name?: greenify
? Author email?: <hidden>
? Github username?: greenify
? Enter keywords for npm (separate with comma): visualization,msa,alignment
? A visualization lib? No
? Unit tests: Yes
? Configure a build system? (Gulp) Yes
? Linting (Check code style with JSHint) No
? Choose your license type: Apache 2
? Is this correct? (Y/n) Yes
~~~


Inside the folder you find following files:

- `.gitignore`: Files that should be ignored by the git versioning system
- `LICENSE`: The license under which you want your source code to be distributed, e.g. MIT or Apache 2
- `index.js`:  Index file over all submodules
- `package.json`: Information about your package: author, version, ...
- `lib` : Folder including your real source code
- `test`: Folder containing your first unit test

(More detailed information will be given later in this tutorial)

{% hlblock info %}
For BioJS 2 components, we have following naming recommendations:

__biojs-[io/rest/vis/algo/...]-[name]__

- Use `io` for components which are responsible for parsing data into a specific format (aka parser)
- Use `vis` for components which are visualizing data sets
- Use `rest` for REST apis to databases
- Use `algo` for server/client side algorithms processing the data (e.g. alignments, neural networks, markov models, graph algorithms)

If you have a better name for your package, please use it.
This naming guideline is only if you are not that creative (like us).
{% endhlblock %}

1b) Available commands
----------------------

### 1. Snippets (only available for visualization -> skip)

Allows you to write minimal example [snippets](https://github.com/biojs/biojs-sniper) of your visualization.
These snippets will be used for the [BioJS registry](http://biojs.io).

~~~
npm run sniper
~~~

and open [http://localhost:9090/snippets](http://localhost:9090/snippets). See the [Sniper repository](https://github.com/biojs/biojs-sniper) for more details. 


### 2. Watchify

Watches all your files and runs [browserify](http://browserify.org) on every change.
Combine this with the sniper.
(Subsequent runs of watchify are fast).

~~~
npm run watch
~~~

Enjoy.

### 3. Test

(only if you enabled it)

~~~
npm run test
~~~

They are grouped into two sections:

* Non-DOM `gulp test-unit` (folder: `test/unit`)
* DOM-only `gulp test-dom` (folder: `test/dom`)

Gotchas:

* The Unit tests are run with PhantomJS, if you want to debug them open the `test/index.html` 
your browser.
* You need to add your _DOM_ tests to the `test/dom/index.js`.

If you want to auto-execute all your test on a file change, run:

~~~
gulp test-watch
~~~

{% hlblock info %}
You can customize the sniper sections with a [local configuration file](https://github.com/biojs/slush-biojs#configuration)
{% endhlblock %}

### 4. More tasks

Depending on the settings you select, the slush bootstraper might add more tasks.
You can see [here](https://github.com/biojs/slush-biojs) the entire list.


2) Our input data 
------------------

First we will have a look at the data. The whole file is a set of ~500K SNPs (Simple Nucleotide Polymorphisms) from [@manuelcorpas][manuelcorpas]). These SNPs come from a saliva sample genotyped using the SNP chip version 2 from [23andMe](https://www.23andme.com/), a personal genomics provider.

SNPs are the minimal unit of genetic variation that an organism may have and correspond to a single letter change in the DNA sequence of an organism (in this case [@manuelcorpas][manuelcorpas]).  

[manuelcorpas]: http://manuelcorpas.com

This file is available at [`files.biojs.net/chromosome/manny`](http://files.biojs.net/chromosomes/manny).

The file is structured as follows:

~~~
rsid chromosome pos genotype
~~~


Genotype is the field that tells us exactly what the sequence looks like at a particular position. It is important to note that Genotype usually has two letters, because, as you may remember from high school biology, humans have two pairs of each chromosome. Well, mostly, unless you are a male, in which case you only have a lonely X copy with a tiny Y chromosome. 

There are 3 types of genotypes that we will look at in this example.

1. If the same letter is present in both copies, then we say that we have a homozygous SNP; e.g.: AA, TT, GG, CC.
2. If the letters are different, then we have a heterozygous SNP: AT, GC, etc. 
3. The position might have been delete in both or either chromosome: --, A-, -G, etc.

These three fields in each feature line are required:

* `rsid` (String): SNP id
* `chromosome` (String): name of the chromosome
* `pos` (int): position in the chromosome
* `genotype`: (String) both residues from the two matching chromosomes (warning: mitochondria (MT) or Y chromosome are haploid)

{% hlblock info %}
For detailed info about the BED format, visit the [ensembl doc](http://www.ensembl.org/info/website/upload/bed.html) or the [UCSC help](http://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html#format1)
{% endhlblock %}


For example:

~~~
rs5747620 20  15412698  TT
rs9605903 20  15434720  CC
rs2236639 20  15452483  GC
rs5747999 21  15455353  AA
rs11089263  21  15467656  A-
rs2096537 21  15474749  AC
rs9604959 22  15479107  CG
rs9604967 22  15492342  CC
~~~


{% hlblock info %}
To make this tutorial as easy as possible, we will only work with this static example. In the [extended parsing](50_real_parser.html) you will learn how to parse the real file with 500,000 rows.
{% endhlblock %}

3) Export your component
------------------------

Now it is time to export your component in order to provide your functionality with the other BioJS components or in your module (e.g your first test case).
We use [CommonJS Syntax](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Modules/1.1) to export modules in BioJS.

Please export your parser in the following way:

~~~
var snipspector = { }

snipspector.parse = function() {
    ...
}

module.exports = snipspector;
~~~

Other BioJS components are able to include your component by using

~~~
var snipspector = require('biojs-io-snipspector');
snipspector.parse();
~~~

Instead of requiring packages, you can also require files:

~~~
var snipspector = require('../lib/index');
snipspector.parse();
~~~

{% hlblock info %}
The path can be either relative `../lib/index.js` or simply the package name `biojs-io-snipspector`.
{% endhlblock %}

{% hlblock info %}
There is a [excellent guide](https://github.com/maxogden/art-of-node#how-require-works) on how the `require` command works under the hood.
{% endhlblock %}

4) The first testcase
----------------------

We already provide you with one test case, in the next section we will show you how to fix this unit test.
You can execute the test suite with:

```
npm test
```

It is really ok if you see errors here - you will fix them later ;-)

{% hlblock info %}
In this tutorial we use [Mocha](https://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/) as JavaScript test framework.
However you can use your favorite - you only need to change the `test` command in the `scripts` section of your `package.json`. 
{% endhlblock %}


5) Start coding
----------------

It is time to code! 
To begin please open now the `lib` folder and access the `index.js` file. 

{% hlblock info %}
You can find the code for this exercise on [github](https://github.com/biojs/biojs-tutorial-template-snp). 
{% endhlblock %}

First have a look at the provided code.

~~~
var snipspector = {};

snipspector.parse = function() {
    
    var data = ["rs5747620  20  15412698  TT",
    "rs9605903  20  15434720  CC",
    "rs2236639  20  15452483  GC",
    "rs5747999  21  15455353  AA",
    "rs11089263 21  15467656  A-",
    "rs2096537  21  15474749  AC",
    "rs9604959  22  15479107  CG",
    "rs9604967  22  15492342  CC"];

    var chromosomes = [];

    // analyze snippets
    // homo(zygous): AA
    // hetero(zygous): AC
    // del(etion): A-, -A or --
    for (var i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
        // Please fill in your code here! 
    }

    console.log(chromosomes); 

    return chromosomes;
}

snipspector.parse(); //Should print [{name: "20", homo: 2, hetero: 1, del: 0,
                     // {name: "21", homo: 1, hetero: 1, del: 1}, 
                     // {name: "22", homo 1, hetero: 1, del: 0 }]

module.exports = snipspector; // Export the object for other components
~~~

You can always run your application directly with with Node, like this:

~~~
node index.js
~~~

{% hlblock help %}
If you are new JavaScript or have not coded for a while, you might want to check out this [Cheatsheet](http://overapi.com/javascript/).
Or this one for a short fresh up of [variables](http://thewebivore.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/PamsJavascriptCheatSheet.pdf).
{% endhlblock %}


6) Your first, big task
---------------------


{% hlblock task %}

Please fill in the missing code inside the for loop so that `snipspector.parse()` counts all homozygous, heterozygous and deleted SNPs. Your task is to count the number or homozygous, heterozygous and deleted SNPs per chromosome. Note that heterozygous deletions are counted as deletions only, not heterozygous SNPs. If you have done a great job your unit test will turn green!

{% endhlblock %}


Sample of format:

~~~
[{name: "chrname", homo: 2, hetero: 0, del: 1}]
~~~

7) Verify your solution
----------------

{% hlblock stop %}

No please do __NOT__ have a look at our solution, if your unit test is green - 
your solution is correct!
Please only continue if your solution is working.

{% endhlblock %}
